# Prediction_using_DT_along_with_Bagging_Classifier
**Bagging Classifier** is an ensemble method that uses multiple estimators which can be trained using sampling techniques like **pasting,bagging/bootstrap aggregation,random subspaces and random patches**.

Simply,this ensemble classifier at end takes all predictions of individual classifier and gives final predictions.

Bagging Classifier helps in reducing variance of algorithms like Decision Tree Classifier and etc(those of high variance).
